# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS
  **PENETRATION TESTING TOOLKIT**: A penetration testing toolkit is a comprehensive set of tools and software that help security professionals evaluate the security of a system by simulating cyber attacks. These toolkits are essential for ethical hackers to identify, exploit, and report vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. Here are some commonly used tools in a penetration testing toolkit: eg:- Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc...
 ***1) Nmap :-** It is a network scanning tool that identifies open ports, services, and hosts on a network.*
 ***2) Metasploit:-** It is a powerful framework used for developing, testing, and executing exploits against target systems.*
 ***3) Wireshark:-** It is a network protocol analyzer that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time.*
 ***4) Burp Suite:-** It is a integrated platform for performing web application security testing, including vulnerability scanning and manual testing.*
 
 **Port Scanner:** This module scans for open ports on target systems to identify potential entry points. Tools like Nmap are popular for this purpose.

**Vulnerability Scanner:** Identifies known vulnerabilities in the target system. Tools like OpenVAS and Nessus are widely used.

**Brute-Force Tool:** Attempts to guess passwords or cryptographic keys through exhaustive trial and error. Tools like Hydra and John the Ripper are common examples.

**Exploit Framework:** Provides a collection of exploits for various vulnerabilities. Metasploit is a well-known framework for this purpose.

**Network Sniffer:** Captures and analyzes network traffic to find sensitive information. Wireshark is a powerful tool for network analysis.

**Web Application Scanner:** Scans web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, etc. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite are popular choices.

**Password Cracker:** Used to crack password hashes. Tools like Hashcat are effective for this.

**Wireless Network Tools:** Includes tools for cracking Wi-Fi passwords and assessing wireless security. Aircrack-ng is a popular suite for this purpose.

**Social Engineering Tools:** Simulates social engineering attacks. SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit) is an example of such a tool.

**Reporting Tools:** Helps in creating detailed reports of the findings. Dradis is a collaborative tool for this purpose.
